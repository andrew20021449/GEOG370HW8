    <p>Using the buffer, intersection, and dissolve functions, I created a map to show the areas within the Town of Chapel Hill limits where a road is within 500 feet of a stream. First, I pulled data on streams, roads, and the town boundary from the Chapel Hill GIS OpenData Page. First, i created a 250 foot buffer around the roads and streams using the buffer function. I then used the interseection function to find the area where those buffers overlapped (under 500 feet between stream and road). I then used the intersection function again between that area and the Town of Chapel Hill limits to filter out surrounding areas. Lastly, I used the dissolve function to combine overlapping areas into single shapes. This map is important to pollution management within Chapel Hill, as roads that are within 500 feet of streams often lead to pollution due to runoff during storms. Rain washes oil, lead, and other contaminants from cars off the road and if streams are too close by, those pollutants could contaminate lakes, rivers, and oceans. Chapel Hill should look into pollution management solutions for these areas to prevent heavy runoffs, especially on some of the biggest roads.</p>
